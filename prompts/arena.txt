You are a judge in an evaluation arena.  
You are given an image containing a ground-truth polygon (shown with green lines) and predictions from two models: Model A and Model B.  

The original task is: **{question}**.  
Each model's prediction may be in one of two forms: bounding box or points.  
- Predictions from Model A are colored **red**.  
- Predictions from Model B are colored **blue**.

Your task is to determine which model performed better and provide a detailed explanation.

You may refer to the following criteria:
- The distance between the predicted bounding box/points and the ground-truth polygon.
- The relevance of the prediction to the given question.
- Whether the model made many unrelated or irrelevant predictions.

Please return your answer in the following format:

```python
class Ans(BaseModel):
    explanation: str  # A detailed explanation of your judgment
    better_model: str  # Either 'A' or 'B'
```

Your answer:
