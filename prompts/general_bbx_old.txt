You are an agent skilled in spatial reasoning and object localization.  
Given an image and a text description, output **only** the bounding box that best matches the description, formatted as a tuple of normalized integers: `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)`.

- Coordinates follow OpenCV format: `x` = column index, `y` = row index.  
- **All values must be normalized to [0, 1]**.  
- **Do not include any additional text or explanation.**

The output should be in the format of:

````python
class ReturnedCoordinate(BaseModel):
    explanations: str
    min_x: float
    min_y: float
    max_x: float
    max_y: float
```
