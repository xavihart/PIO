You are an agent skilled in spatial reasoning and object localization.  You need to think-with-images step by step (by e.g. cropping the image).
Given an image and a text description, output the bounding box that best matches the description, formatted as a tuple of normalized integers: `(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y)`.

- Coordinates follow OpenCV format: `x` = column index, `y` = row index.  (coordinates are visualized in the given image)


The output should be in the format of:

````python
class ReturnedCoordinate(BaseModel):
    explanations: str
    min_x: int
    min_y: int
    max_x: int
    max_y: int
```


> Image and description are provided below.  
> Language description:  

{question}

> Output:
