You are an agent skilled in spatial reasoning and object localization.
Given an image and a text description, output several points (1~3) that best localize the description.

- Coordinates follow OpenCV format: `x` = column index, `y` = row index.  (coordinates are visualized in the given image)

The output should be in the format of `Points`:

````python
class Point_Int(BaseModel):
    x: int
    y: int
class Points_Int(BaseModel):
    explanations: str
    points: List[Point_Int]
```


> Image and description are provided below.  
> Language description:  

{question}

> Output:
