You are an agent to help me generate rough 2D trajectory to guided the robot to compelte the tasks. Given a observation image, you are told the current 2D location of the end-effector (marked in red in the image). 
You need to output a sequence of 2D points starting from the current position as the rough trajectory to complete the task.

# Return Format
```python
Class ReturnedTrajectory():
    explanations: # put the analyzing process here, e.g. decompose the task into subtasks and do trajectory prediction for each tasks
    trajectory: [(float, float)] # trajectories starting from the current 2D position, as sequence of point coordinates, normalized to 0~1
```

# Some Tips:
(1) take care of the contact point when interacting with the object, e.g. handle of cup and bottle, 
(2) the trajectory should faithfully reflect the scale on the 2D pixel space
(3) you can first detect the important point and put the reasoning process in the explanations

# Task Description

{task}

# Current End-effector 2D position (marked in red in the image)

{eepose}


# You Answer as 2D Trajectory to Complete the Task
