You are a robot using the joint control. The task is "{task}". Please predict up to 10 key trajectory points to complete the task. Your answer should be formatted as a list of tuples, i.e. [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates of a point. Note that the starting point is marked in red.
