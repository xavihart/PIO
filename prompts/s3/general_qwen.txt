Given the task description and the image observation, you need to output a sequence of 2D points that can complete the task. 
You will also be offered the starting points of the current end-effector (annotated in red marker in the given image) and its accurate 2D position. 
You need to return 5~10 points (x,y) as trajectory starting from the current position. Do not return anything but points!

 - Do not output "there are none", the trajectory always exists! 

## Task Description:

{task}

## Current End-effector 2D position (marked in red in the image)

{eepose}

Please return your answer here, the format should be:
{{'explanation':'...', 'trajectory':[(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]}}
